    <p id="intro">
      This is the three-stage process of how I found my life to be intertwined
      with data, writing, and digital media. I explored how music is an
      example of how something so seemingly unquantifiable can
       display a significant trend and further add to how
      the internet can infringe on my privacy.

        <p>
          To begin to uncover the connection between data and I, I chose
          to focus on something that has always been, and will always be,
          an integral part of my life: Music. I noticed that throughout my
          day, I listen to all kinds of music. However, my music is
          constantly interrupted due to scheduled activity. <br><br>I chose to record what song type I listened to and
          how I felt at that time on a scale of 1-10. I only chose to record the
          first song of every session because it is chosen and meaningful
          rather than a shuffle of my playlist. I then added several other factors
          such as the time of day, temperature, and stress level. This table is
          the result of consistently recording my music and corresponding mood
          for a week.

        This is a visualization is what I saw to be most stark in the data I
        collected over the week. I seperated the data into different reoccuring
        feelings over the week. Each emotion firework has an explosion that
        relates explosion size and level of stress. Each explosion has a colored fragment
        that is an instance of that genre played. <br><br> I learned there was
        a significant trend between being happy, listening to Hip-Hop, and
        having the least amount of stress. The point is that there is correlation
        even though it may not be incredibly apparent due to the sample size. You
        could argue that Hip-Hop can invoke and connotes a lighter mood. Perhaps it
        could then be used to advertise something to me.

        This video is how my own data can be a commodity to influencial
        companies. I chose to specifically explore <i>data brokering</i> and how
        the music streaming service I use can be used by Facebook in an effort to create a better
        experience. <br><br> Facebook's <u>Connect with Facebook</u> service
        is how my data can become a part of the digitalization of
        me. Facebook has access to everything I do on their website and with
        their service they can add different perspectives. In the case of music,
        since I found that there was a trend within my use, my music choice
        could potentially add to Facebook's algorithms.
